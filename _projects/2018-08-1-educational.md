## Description

This App helps self service restaurants to maximize their productivity by allowing the customers to place their orders using a virtual menu in real time.

### The App consists of two clients:
#### One for the patrons, where the items in the menus, special offers, prices etc are displayed synched to a in-cloud data base, which allows them to place their order without having to stand in line.

#### One for the restuarant manager, where the items in the menu can be updated, and the orders placed by the customers can be viewed in real time, an option to print out the tickets is available as well as an option to view the tickets virtually

## Technologies Used

* **.Net Framework**
* **Azure Cloud Services**
* **SQL Server**

## My role in this project

### This Project was created for a University Practical Course of 8+ Credits, we worked against the clock and used an Agile framework (Scrum) to meet with the client on a weekly basis and deliver a MVP each time.

### I had the role of the tech lead for our team as well as the Scrum Master when assining the different tasks.

#### Since we had to create this from the ground up, and we were competing against other teams we focused on creating a simple but elegant product. Following the "less but better" mindset, we succeeded in creating a professional looking working prototype and assumed different roles throughout the project. 

#### I created the logo for our product and paid attention to polish the final look as well as the efficiency of the code, specifically in the Cloud synchronization and architecture

#### Our Team went the extra mile creating a pitch deck and defending the Product in front of the Professors in charge as well as the Faculty Dean.
