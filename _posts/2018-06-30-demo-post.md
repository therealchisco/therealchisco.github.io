> "Okay class I'm not a writer heh"

That will become quite apparent really soon. However, I've "dabbled" in journaling since I was in primary school and read _"Pantalones Cortos"_ by the beloved Costa Rican children's book author Lara Rios. 

The book is the journal of a kid in elementary school who gets into "all sorts of fun adventures" or something like that. To be honest, I don't remember much about the book, but I DO remember an important detail, Namely that the main character refuses to call his journal his "Dear Diary" because that would imply he writes on it daily. Daily entries are too much commitment for a busy 3rd grader [Citation needer] so he instead chooses to write something every other day. Anyway I think that little quirk got so ingrained into my notion about journals that I never really felt guilty about forgetting to journal for a few days, weeks, ..., years

One time I found an old notebook with (05.10.2007) on one entry and (03.05.2010) on the next

This has also taken the shape of multiple pocket-sized notebooks that I've started with the intention to always carry them so I can jot down the next _big idea_ that might come to me in an epiphany. 

Most recently whilst rsynching some data files I was reminded of yet another medium in which I've attempted to keep my chronicles PLAIN TEXT FILES, scattered around countless hard drives in directories called "ideas/" and  ambitious file names "idea001", that inspired this very vaporwave project in case you want to check it out

But as much as I love nostalgia I figured it's high time to 'modernize' my writing and put some of it in the cloud. That way it's gonna be impossible to misplace it, hopefully, it'll help me improve my skills now that I know that someone else might be reading it, I'll put an extra effort to make it a little bit more intelligible. 
And who knows maybe somebody else might find it useful and/or entertaining.

PS: I don't know how often I'll post, but I'll try to always include a Tim Ferrissesque "5 bullet" thingy at the end

PIC OF THE POST





##

This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.

We've included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |

And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

[^1]: Beautiful modern, minimal theme design.
[^2]: Powerful features to show off your work.
[^3]: Maintained and supported by the theme developer.

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148003889" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Pretty cool, huh?

We've packed this theme with powerful features to show off your work.

Why not put them to use on your new portfolio?
