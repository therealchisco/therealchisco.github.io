## About me

I am a software developer with a strong background in computer science. I enjoy finding elegant and clean solutions to real-world software engineering challanges by applying the theoretical knowledge and practical skills I've acquired over many years.

I strive to learn something new everyday by staying curious and asking the right questions, In turn  I try to communicate and share my knowledge with others in a clear way whenever I get a chance. _check out [my blog](/blog/) or [this ongoing project](http://google.com) to learn more_

Over the years I've come to understand just how important team work and community are and for that reason I keep an open mind and  try to make most of [my side projects](/projects/) open source, no matter how small. Finally I'm proud to say that I contribute to [other projects](www.google.com) and initiatives I genuninely believe are the future.
